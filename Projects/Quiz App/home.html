          <h2>Programming</h2>
          A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer
          programs. Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax
          (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language.
          Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables,
          and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming
          language is required in order to execute programs, namely an
          interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source
          code, while a compiler produces an executable program.

          <h2>5 major types of programming languages</h2>
          <p>
            While you'll find dozens of ways to classify various programming
            languages, they generally fall into five major categories. Keep in
            mind that some languages may fall under more than one type:
          </p>
          <h4>1. Procedural programming languages</h4>
          <p>
            procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in
            order to achieve a desired output. Each series of steps is called a
            procedure, and a program written in one of these languages will have
            one or more procedures within it. Common examples of procedural
            languages include:
          </p>
          1. C and C++ <br />
          2. Java <br />
          3. Pascal <br />
          4. BASIC
          <p>
            C++ is a great programming language to learn if you're also
            interested in learning more about how computers function. While it
            may not be as readable as other high-level programming languages
            like Python, it can still be beginner-friendly. You can give it a
            try for free by enrolling in Codio's introductory online program,
            Programming in C++: A Hands-on Introduction Specialization. After a
            month, you'll have created and ran your first program in C++.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Functional programming languages</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional
            languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and
            evaluations. Each function–a reusable module of code–performs a
            specific task and returns a result. The result will vary depending
            on what data you input into the function. Some popular functional
            programming languages include:
          </p>
          <li>Scala</li>
          <li>Erlang</li>
          <li>Haskell</li>
          <li>Elixir</li>
          <li>F#</li>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <h2>3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages</h2>
          <p>
            This type of language treats a program as a group of objects
            composed of data and program elements, known as attributes and
            methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other
            programs. This makes it a popular language type for complex
            programs, as code is easier to reuse and scale. Some common
            object-oriented languages include:
          </p>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
